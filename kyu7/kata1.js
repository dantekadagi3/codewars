//so i want to sort the array first then set an initial value to A[0]
//this A[0] will be like a flag  if the flag==A[i] then an initial count value 
// which is set to zero will be increased  but when it happens to be greater than A[0]
//we do the modulus of count by 2 then if it is not equal to zero we push the flag to an empty array named odd
